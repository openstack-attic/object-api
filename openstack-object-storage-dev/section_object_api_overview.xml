    <title>Object Storage API overview</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage is an object-based storage system
        that stores content and metadata as objects. You create,
        modify, and get objects and metadata by using the Object
        Storage API, which is implemented as a set of Representational
        State Transfer (REST) web services.</para>
    <para>You use the HTTPS (SSL) protocol to interact with Object
        Storage, and you use standard HTTP calls to perform API
        operations. You can also use language-specific APIs, which use
        the ReSTful API, that make it easier for you to integrate into
        your applications.</para>
    <para>To assert your right to access and change data in an
        account, you identify yourself to Object Storage by using an
            <link xlink:href="authentication">authentication</link>
        token. To get a token, you present your credentials to an
        authentication service. The authentication service returns a
        token and the URL for the account. Depending on which
        authentication service that you use, the URL for the account
        appears in:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">OpenStack Identity
                        Service</emphasis>. The URL is defined in the
                    service catalog.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Tempauth</emphasis>. The
                    URL is provided in the
                        <literal>X-Storage-Url</literal> response
                    header.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>In both cases, the URL is the full URL and
        includes the account resource.</para>
    <para>The Object Storage API supports the standard, non-serialized
        response format, which is the default, and both JSON and XML
            <link xlink:href="serialized-response-formats">serialized
            response formats</link>.</para>
    <para>The Object Storage system organizes data in a hierarchy, as
        follows:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Account</emphasis>. Represents
                the top-level of the hierarchy.</para>
            <para>Your service provider creates your account and you
                own all resources in that account. The account defines
                a namespace for containers. A container might have the
                same name in two different accounts.</para>
            <para>In the OpenStack environment, the account is
                synonymous with a project or tenant.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Container</emphasis>. Contains
                objects. You can create any number of containers
                within an account.</para>
            <para>In addition to containing objects, you can also use
                the container to control access to objects by using an
                Access Control List (ACL). You cannot store an ACL
                with individual objects.</para>
            <para>In addition, you configure and control many other features, such as <link
                    xlink:href="set-object-versions">object
                    versioning</link>, at
                the container level. The container defines a namespace
                for objects. An object of the same name in two
                different containers represents two different
                objects.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Object</emphasis>. Stores data
                content, such as documents, images, and so on.</para>
            <para>You can also store custom metadata with the
                object.</para>
            <para>You can store an unlimited number of objects. Each
                object can be as large as 5 GBs. With <link
                    xlink:href="large-object-creation">large object
                    creation</link>, you can upload and store objects
                of any size. You can also associate custom metadata
                with an object, use <link xlink:href="cors-headers"
                    >cross-origin resource sharing</link> to manage
                object security, <link xlink:href="file-compression"
                    >compress files</link>, <link
                    xlink:href="browser-bypass">save a file rather
                    than opening it</link>, and <link
                    xlink:href="expire-objects">schedule objects for
                    deletion</link>.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The account, container, and object hierarchy affects the way
        you interact with the Object Storage API. Specifically, the
        resource path reflects this structure and has this
        format:</para>
    <programlisting>/v1/{account}/{container}/{object}</programlisting>
    <para>For example, for the <literal>flowers/rose.jpg</literal>
        object in the <literal>images</literal> container in the
            <literal>12345678912345</literal> account, the resource
        path
        is:<programlisting>/v1/12345678912345/images/flowers/rose.jpg</programlisting>Notice
        that the object name contains the <literal>/</literal>
        character. This slash does not indicate that Object Storage
        has a sub-hierarchy called <literal>flowers</literal> because
        containers do not store objects in actual sub-folders.
        However, the inclusion of <literal>/</literal> or a similar
        convention inside object names enables you to create <link
            xlink:href="pseudo-hierarchical-folders-directories"
            >pseudo-hierarchical folders and
        directories</link>.</para>
    <para>For example, if the endpoint for Object Storage is
            <literal>objects.mycloud.com</literal>, the returned URL
        is
            <literal>https://objects.mycloud.com/v1/12345678912345</literal>.</para>
    <para>To access a container, append the container name to the
        resource path.</para>
    <para>To access an object, append the container and the object
        name to the path.</para>
    <para>If you have a large number of containers or objects, you can
        user query parameters to <link xlink:href="large-lists">page
            through large lists of containers or objects</link>. Use
        the <parameter>marker</parameter>,
            <parameter>limit</parameter>, and
            <parameter>end_marker</parameter> query parameters to
        control how many items are returned in a list and where the
        list starts or ends.</para>
    <para>Object Storage HTTP requests have the following default
        constraints:</para>
    <informaltable rules="all">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Maximum value</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Number of HTTP headers</td>
                <td>90</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of HTTP headers</td>
                <td>4096 bytes</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length per HTTP request line</td>
                <td>8192 bytes</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of HTTP request</td>
                <td>5 GBs</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of container names</td>
                <td>256 bytes</td>
                <td>Cannot contain the <literal>/</literal>
                    character.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of object names</td>
                <td>1024 bytes</td>
                <td>By default, there are no character
                    restrictions.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </informaltable>
    <para>Container and object names must be UTF-8 encoded and
        properly URL-encoded before you call the API binding. If you
        use an API binding that performs the URL-encoding for you, do
        not URL-encode the container and object names before you call
        the API binding. Otherwise, you double-encode these names.
        Check the length restrictions against the URL-encoded
        string.</para>
