    <title>Language-Specific API Bindings</title>
    <para>A set of supported API bindings in several popular languages are available from the
        Rackspace Cloud Files product, which uses OpenStack Object Storage code for its
        implementation. These bindings provide a layer of abstraction on top of the base REST
        API, allowing programmers to work with a container and object model instead of working
        directly with HTTP requests and responses. These bindings are free (as in beer and as in
        speech) to download, use, and modify. They are all licensed under the MIT License as
        described in the COPYING file packaged with each binding. If you do make any
        improvements to an API, you are encouraged (but not required) to submit those changes
        back to us.</para>
    <para>The API bindings for Rackspace Cloud Files are hosted at <link
        xlink:href="http://github.com/rackspace">http://github.com/rackspace</link>. Feel
        free to coordinate your changes through github or, if you prefer, send your changes to
        cloudfiles@rackspacecloud.com. Just make sure to indicate which language and version you
        modified and send a unified diff.</para>
    <para>Each binding includes its own documentation (either HTML, PDF, or CHM). They also
        include code snippets and examples to help you get started. The currently supported API
        binding for OpenStack Object Storage are:</para>

    <para>There are no other supported language-specific bindings at this time. You are welcome
        to create your own language API bindings and we can help answer any questions during
        development and give you full credit for your work.</para>
