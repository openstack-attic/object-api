    <title>Page through lists of containers</title>
    <para>If you have a large number of containers, it is sometimes
        more convenient to page through them than getting some big
        long list of them. If I create more containers and then do a
        regular listing, here's what it looks like with five
        containers:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>curl –X GET -i \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: fc81aaa6-98a1-9ab0-94ba-aba9a89aa9ae" \

    <para>Suppose I want a page size of 2, all I do is append a
        ""?limit=2"" to my URL:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>curl –X GET -i \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: fc81aaa6-98a1-9ab0-94ba-aba9a89aa9ae" \

    <para>Not surprisingly, I only get two containers. To get the next
        page, you tell the system which item you last saw with the
        "marker=" specifier:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>curl –X GET -i \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: fc81aaa6-98a1-9ab0-94ba-aba9a89aa9ae" \
    https://storage.swiftdrive.com/v1/CF_xer7_343?marker=dogs\&amp;limit=2</userinput>

    <para>Notice that I had to use \&amp; so that my bash shell didn't
        try to interpret the &amp; as wanting to run something in its
        own thread. With that in place, you get the next page of items
        that appear after the marker.</para>
