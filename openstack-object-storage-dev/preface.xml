    <title>Preface</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage is an affordable, redundant,
        scalable, and dynamic storage service offering. The core
        storage system provides a safe, secure, automatically
        re-sizing and network-accessible way to store and retrieve
        object content and metadata. The Object Storage API is
        implemented as a set of Representational State Transfer (REST)
        web services. You can store an unlimited number of objects.
        Each object can be as large as 5 GBs. With large object
        creation, you can upload and store objects of any size. You
        can also use language-specific APIs, which use the ReSTful API
        but make it easier for you to integrate into your
        applications.</para>

        <title>Intended audience</title>
        <para>This guide is intended to assist software developers who
            want to develop applications using the OpenStack Object
            Storage API. It fully documents the ReST application
            programming interface (API) that allows developers to
            interact with the storage components of the OpenStack
            Object Storage system. To use the information provided
            here, you should first have a general understanding of the
            Object Storage service and have access to an installation
            of Object Storage. You should also be familiar with
            ReSTful web services and HTTP/1.1.</para>
        <para>You can also find language-specific APIs in several
            popular programming languages such as C#/.NET, Java, PHP,
            Python, and Ruby. These APIs use the ReST API and help
            developers rapidly integrate Object Storage support into
            their applications without needing to write at the ReST
            interface. Each API includes its own documentation in its
            native format. For example, the Java API includes Javadoc
            documentation.</para>
