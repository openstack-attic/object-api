    <title>General API information</title>
    <para>The Object Storage API is implemented as a set of
        Representational state transfer (REST) web services. You use
        standard HTTP calls to perform authentication and
        account-level, container-level, and object-level operations.
        For more information, see <link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"
            >Representational state transfer</link>.</para>
    <para>Object Storage HTTP requests have the following
        constraints:</para>
    <informaltable rules="all">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Maximum value</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Number of HTTP headers</td>
                <td>90</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of HTTP headers</td>
                <td>4096 bytes</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length per HTTP request line</td>
                <td>8192 bytes</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of HTTP request</td>
                <td>5 GBs</td>
                <td/>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of container names</td>
                <td>256 bytes</td>
                <td>Cannot contain the <literal>/</literal>
                    character.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length of object names</td>
                <td>1024 bytes</td>
                <td>No character restrictions.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </informaltable>
    <para>Container and object names must be UTF-8 encoded and
        properly URL-encoded before you call the API binding. If you
        use an API binding that performs the URL-encoding for you, do
        not URL-encode the container and object names before you call
        the API binding. Otherwise, you double-encode these names.
        Check the length restrictions against the URL-encoded
        string.</para>
    <para>Each Object Storage API request must include an
            <firstterm>authentication token</firstterm> in the
            <code>X-Auth-Token</code> HTTP header. Clients use an
        authentication service to obtain this token and the OpenStack
        Object Storage URLs. For information, see <xref
            linkend="authentication-object-dev-guide"/>.</para>
    <para><!--There are actually two different sets of ReST services that make up the full OpenStack Object Storage product. -->You
        specify the Object Storage URL in the
            <code>X-Storage-Url</code> header. This service manages
        the system data. Example operations include creating
        containers and uploading objects.
        <!--The second ReST service is for managing the CDN feature of OpenStack Object Storage and is identified by <code>X-CDN-Management-Url</code>.--></para>
    <para>The purpose of each HTTP method depends on which service the
        call is made against. For example, a &PUT; request against the
        service specified in the <code>X-Storage-Url</code> header is
        used to create containers and upload
        objects.<!--, while a &PUT; request against the <code>X-CDN-Management-Url</code> is used to CDN-enable a container--></para>
    <para>The language-specific APIs mask this system separation from
        the programmer. They simply create a container and mark it
            <emphasis>public</emphasis> and it handles calling out to
        the appropriate back-end services using the appropriate ReST
        API.</para>
    <note>
        <para>All requests to authenticate and operate against
            OpenStack Object Storage are performed using SSL over HTTP
            (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Use the ReST API to interact with the storage component of
        OpenStack Object Storage. All requests are directed to the
        host and URL described in the <code>X-Storage-Url</code> HTTP
        header obtained during successful authentication.</para>
    <para>The following sections describe the tasks that you can
        perform in the storage system:</para>
