    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage is an affordable, redundant,
        scalable, and dynamic storage service offering. The core
        storage system is designed to provide a safe, secure,
        automatically re-sizing and network-accessible way to store
        data. You can store an unlimited quantity of files and each
        file can be as large as 5 GBs, plus with large object
        creation, you can upload and store objects of virtually any
        size. </para>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage allows users to store and retrieve
        files and content through a simple Web Service interface
        (ReST: Representational State Transfer). There are also
        language-specific APIs that utilize the ReSTful API but make
        it much easier for developers to integrate into their
        applications.</para>

        <title>Intended Audience</title>
        <para>This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop applications
            using the OpenStack Object Storage API. It fully documents the ReST application
            programming interface (API) that allows developers to interact with the storage
            components of the OpenStack Object Storage system. To use the information provided here,
            you should first have a general understanding of the OpenStack Object Storage service
            and have access to an installation of OpenStack Object Storage. You should also be
            familiar with: </para>

        <para>You can also find language-specific APIs in several popular programming languages such
            as C#/.NET, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. These APIs utilize the ReST API and are
            provided to help developers rapidly integrate OpenStack Object Storage support into
            their applications without needing to write at the ReST interface. Each API includes its
            own documentation in its native format. For example, the Java API includes
            JavaDocs.</para>
